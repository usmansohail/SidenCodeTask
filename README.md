# SidenCodeTask
Implementation of Siden Fullstack Coding Task

## Description:
We have a file (can be a very large file (up to 100 GB)), which contains a lot
of words and each word is on a new line (file sample -
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mmFQVmWJT4entvG5OVOSxcG_uT9XUSAa/view?usp=sharing)


## Requirements:

1) Implement "PUT" HTTP endpoint which will save/replace file on the disk
2) Implement "GET "HTTP endpoint which will return "processed" file without
word duplicates
3) Implementation must run in 8GB of RAM. Assume that you will not have enough
memory to fit the entirety of the file in memory
